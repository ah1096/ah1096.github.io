Create a blog post teaser on the Blog page.  Link the blog post teaser to a new blog-post-sprint-1.html page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Your blog post teaser and blog post should be styled to match your blog post wireframe and 'styleguide.html' that you created earlier this week.

1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
-* Fear of being embarassed by lack of knowledge. I'm not used to being a beginner, and it's hard to be the person being helped and not the one helping other people. 
2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
-* I would like to learn more in general about Bootstrap; I feel like it is an incredibly useful tool that I am poorly wielding.
3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
-* It feels like I can get a lot more input on what I'm doing because everyone is working on the same thing at the same time. There's more camaraderie and it feels nice to be in a group as opposed to working at my desk at home.
4. What is your “Why”?
-* The field of education, despite being essential, does not pay well. I want to synthesize my current skills with the skills I am learning in this bootcamp to ensure myself a well-paying (by my standards) and flexible job.
