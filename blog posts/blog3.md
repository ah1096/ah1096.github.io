# Blog Post 3

1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
    - An analogy: HTML is the bones, CSS is the skin, and Javascript is the muscles. I'm interested in learning more about all three, but Javascript in particular.
2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
    - My blog is fairly minimalist and the main object is uses is headings.
3. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
    - It's easier than I thought, but I'm tempted to revert to plain English sometimes. I need to learn more about pseudocode formatting.
