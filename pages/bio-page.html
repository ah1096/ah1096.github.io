<h1>about me</h1> 
<p>
    My name is Alyssa, and I'm from Georgetown, KY. 
    From August of 2019 up until two week from the writing of this webpage I was on the 
    JET Programme teaching English to Japanese elementary and junior high school students in Kawanishi, 
    Japan.

<h2>what I'm into</h2>
<ul>
    <li><bold>artðŸŽ¨<bold> 
        I want to branch out into gouache painting and ceramics, but right now I'm pretty handy with pen and pencil.
        Inspirations include Audra au Clair, John William Waterhouse, Philip de Lazslo, and Alphonse Mucha (+ art nouveau in general)
    </li>
    
    <li><bold>video gamesðŸŽ®</bold> 
        Favorites include The Elder Scrolls IV and V, Animal Crossing, 
        the Sims franchise (Sims 2 for gameplay, Sims 3 for open-world, Sims 4 for build mode),
        the Pokemon franchise (top 3 = R/S/E, FR/LG, and D/P/P),
        and recently The Witcher III: Wild Hunt
    </li>

    <li><bold>films ðŸŽ¬</bold> I'm into artsy weird things and films that are potentially prettier than they are comprehensible.
        Talk to me about A24 horror movies, Wes Anderson films, Studio Ghibli, and Satoshi Kon
